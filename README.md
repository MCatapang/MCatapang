# Hey! How's it going?

Hope you're doing well. My name is **Michael** and I'm an undergraduate student at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu).
I'm currently pivoting into the tech industry by learning through a 3-stack Software Developer bootcamp,

Looking forward to seeing what comes next!
