# Introduction

## About Me

In June of 2022, I simultaneously attained certification in software development through a full-time coding bootcamp, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in pre-law studies from UC Irvine. I am proud to say that achieving both at the same time was one of the biggest accomplishments I've had to date â€“ but I am even prouder to say that doing so is a testament to strengths that I have fostered.

On the technical side, I have found success in implementing several programming languages (e.g., C#, Python, MQL, SQL, JavaScript, JSX, HTML5, CSS), frameworks & libraries (e.g., ASP.NET, EF Core, React, Mongoose, Axios, Express, Flask, AJAX, Jinjia2, Flask, Bootstrap), and tools (e.g., MongoDB, Node.JS, AWS, JSON, RESTful APIs, MySQL Workbench, Git, GitHub).

On the behavioral side, I find joy in providing highly viable solutions to client needs. I am a proficient learner, valuable for navigating the ever-changing technological landscape we now live in. I am multifaceted: able to work client-side, front-end, server-side, and back-end. But most importantly, I can thrive in both team settings and solo assignments.

My areas of choice are Javascript, MERN, and C# / ASP.NET Core. If you're passionate in any of those, let's connect and collaborate!
