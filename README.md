# Introduction

## About Me

In June of 2022, I simultaneously attained certification in software development through a full-time coding bootcamp, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in pre-law studies from UC Irvine. I am proud to say that achieving both at the same time was one of the biggest accomplishments I've had to date â€“ but I am even prouder to say that doing so is a testament to strengths that I have fostered.

On the technical side, I have found success in implementing several programming languages (e.g., C#, Visual Basic, Python, SQL, JavaScript, JSX, HTML5, CSS), frameworks & libraries (e.g., ASP.NET, EF Core, React, Mongoose, Axios, Express, Flask, AJAX, Jinjia2, Flask, Bootstrap), and tools (e.g., MongoDB, Node.JS, AWS, JSON, RESTful APIs, MySQL Workbench, Git, GitHub).

My list of preferred tech includes C#, .NET 6, SQL, and JavaScript - let me know if you'd like to collab!
